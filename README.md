**Notice: DO NOT Use the default invite link**

**There is a default invite link for a private groupchat in Telegram, which at the top of link list. The property of this invite link cannot be changes, which means that bot cannot verify the new member joined with this invite link.**

## Verification-After-Join Mode

In the groups linked with a channel, you can use this mode to verify new members.

1. Add the bot to the group.
2. Promote the bot to admin.
3. Edit the admin rights, minimum rights are recommended.

**Notice: The permission of "Invite Users via Link" CAN NOT be enabled on verification-after-join mode.**

**The bot will automatically handle the verification process. New members will be restricted after joining the group until they pass the CAPTCHA.**
